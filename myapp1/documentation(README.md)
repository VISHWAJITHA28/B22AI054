# Project Notes: URL Shortener React App

## Overview
This project is a simple URL Shortener web application built using React. The main goal is to allow users to shorten long URLs, view a list of shortened URLs, and track basic statistics like redirects and clicks. 

## Main Features
- **URL Shortening:** Users can enter a long URL and get a short version.
- **URL List:** Displays all shortened URLs for easy access.
- **Redirect Handling:** When a user visits a short URL, the app redirects them to the original URL and logs the event.
- **Statistics:** Basic stats like number of redirects and clicks are tracked and shown.
- **Logging:** All important actions (shortening, redirecting, clicking) are logged using a custom logger utility, now located in `src/middleware/logger.js`.

## Folder Structure
- `src/components/` — Contains all React components (forms, lists, handlers, etc.)
- `src/middleware/` — Contains logging utilities and middleware code
- `public/` — Static files and assets

## How It Works
- The user enters a URL in the form and clicks 'Shorten'.
- The app generates a short code and displays it in the list.
- When a short URL is visited, the app finds the original URL and redirects the user.
- Every time a URL is shortened, redirected, or clicked, a log entry is created (visible in the browser console).

## Logging Middleware
- The logger was moved to `src/middleware/logger.js` for better organization.
- All logging functions (shorten, redirect, click) are imported from this file in the components.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the app: `npm start`
3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## GitHub
- The project is pushed to: https://github.com/vishwajitha28/B22AI054

## Notes
- This is a frontend-only demo. There is no backend or database.
- All data is stored in memory and will reset on page reload.
